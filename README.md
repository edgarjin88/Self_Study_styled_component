This repository is created for my study and future reference purpose. 
You can find the original code from the udemy lecture from
1. [React Instagram Clone -css Grid Mastery ](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-with-react/)

Following the lectures, there could be some typos or minor changes, so I highly recommand to refer to the orignial lectures or original git repository :).
